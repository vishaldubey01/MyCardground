 General:
 My name is Vishal Dubey. I am 18 years old and just graduated from Seminole High School, Sanford, FL. I am a computer programmer and I invest countless hours in pursuits in this field.
 Experience:
 I am a self-taught Swift programmer and I have been programming since I was a freshman, starting with Java. Now, I have an advanced knowledge of Python and Java as well as a beginner knowledge of Swift (which I hope to expand).
 Interests:
 My hobbies include playing cards, golf, mathematics, tennis, piano and programming (of course ðŸ˜„). I use programming in my life everyday and this fact insipired me to learn Swift and create this interactive playground. I chose to use playing cards because my fondest memories are with friends playing card games.
 Pursuits:
 I have placed at many programming competitions around the state of Florida. I am also currently working on acquiring more knowledge about Swift and Apple app development to hopefully publish an app I am developing for my school on the AppStore.
